Soma asked us to upload our homework & so we did because we love soma and we do what he says  This homework shows some ways of looking at beers and dogs in new york city -- are both of these elemets equally essential in helping us understand the city a little better? maybe.

Beers in NYC

This dataset includes all the types of beers in all the breweries in all the boroughs. It's super exciting! This is how I first discovered teh ABUs of different kinds of beers and grew to appreciate the art of brewing more deeply.

Dogs in NYC

Although no one has a dog named Areeba, there is a dog named Fatima, and some dogs with serious adult names. This is a dataset that includes all the registered dogs in NYC, whether they are neutered or not, and if they were trained to be guard dogs.
